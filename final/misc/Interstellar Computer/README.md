## Description
Felt depressed after being hacked by ln y. ln y's friend upgraded his computer into a
computational abomination. This newly modified computer can simulate a 1:100 scale of
the planet Earth. Because of this, even more complicated equations have emerged. This
time, he truly believes that no one can decrypt his data.

Once again... prove him wrong. >:
